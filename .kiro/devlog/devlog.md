## Week 3: Foundation & Research (Jan 19-23)

### Day 15 (Jan 19) - Project Setup & Research [4h]
- **9:00-12:00**: Comprehensive research on design ideas and project foundation
- **13:00-14:00**: Project structure organization and documentation cleanup
- **Decision**: Established docs/ directory structure for better project organization
- **Kiro Usage**: Used Git workflow automation and development log system for progress tracking

---

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Architecture Choices
- **Documentation Structure**: Centralized docs/ directory for better project organization
- **Development Tracking**: Implemented comprehensive devlog system for progress monitoring
- **Project Foundation**: Research-first approach to ensure solid architectural decisions

### Kiro CLI Integration Highlights
- **Git Workflow**: Automated branch creation, commit formatting, and PR generation
- **Development Log**: Structured daily progress tracking with technical metrics
- **Documentation**: Streamlined project organization and cleanup processes

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Project Structure**: Organized scattered documentation into logical directory structure
2. **Progress Tracking**: Implemented systematic development logging for hackathon documentation
