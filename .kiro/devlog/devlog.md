## Week 3: Foundation & Research (Jan 19-23)

### Day 15 (Jan 19) - Architecture & PRD Development [6h]

#### 📊 **Daily Metrics**
- **Time Spent**: 6 hours (Planning & Architecture)
- **Commits Made**: 0 (Planning day)
- **Lines Added**: 0 (Documentation day)
- **Lines Removed**: 0
- **Net Lines**: 0
- **Files Modified**: 12 (staged deletions + new PRD)

#### 🎯 **Accomplishments**
- Nailed architecture and final feature ideas for work CLI
- Setup agent commands for development workflow
- Setup steering documents for Kiro CLI integration
- Created first comprehensive PRD for the project
- Established clear project direction and scope

#### 💻 **Technical Progress**
**Repository Status:**
- Staged deletions: 12 old prompt files cleaned up
- New directory created: `.claude/PRPs/prds/`
- PRD generated: `work-cli-unified-task-management.prd.md`
- Current branch: main
- Total project stats: 17,314 lines added, 658 removed across 14 commits

**Key Files Created:**
- Complete PRD with problem statement, solution architecture, and implementation phases
- Structured planning documentation for agent-human collaborative workflows

#### 🔧 **Work Breakdown**
- **Architecture Planning**: 3h - Finalized adapter pattern, stateless execution model
- **PRD Development**: 2h - Comprehensive product requirements document
- **Workflow Setup**: 1h - Agent commands and steering documents

#### 🚧 **Challenges & Solutions**
- No significant challenges - productive planning session with clear outcomes
- Smooth workflow with comprehensive research paying off

#### 🧠 **Key Decisions**
- **Architecture**: Confirmed adapter pattern for multi-backend support
- **MVP Scope**: Local-fs adapter + core commands + Telegram notifications
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript/Node.js with oclif framework
- **Implementation Phases**: 5-phase approach starting with project scaffolding

#### 📚 **Learnings & Insights**

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Architecture Choices
- **Documentation Structure**: Centralized docs/ directory for better project organization
- **Development Tracking**: Implemented comprehensive devlog system for progress monitoring
- **Project Foundation**: Research-first approach to ensure solid architectural decisions

### Kiro CLI Integration Highlights
- **Git Workflow**: Automated branch creation, commit formatting, and PR generation
- **Development Log**: Structured daily progress tracking with technical metrics
- **Documentation**: Streamlined project organization and cleanup processes

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Project Structure**: Organized scattered documentation into logical directory structure
2. **Progress Tracking**: Implemented systematic development logging for hackathon documentation
